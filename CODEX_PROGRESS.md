# Codex Progress

Last updated: 2026-07-19

## Completed work

- Inspected the initial repository, Node/npm/Git toolchain, and GitHub authentication.
- Confirmed a clean `main` branch with only the initial README and MIT license.
- Generated the original full-screen Copper River Delta gameplay art-direction concept.
- Selected TypeScript, Phaser 3, Vite, Vitest, Playwright, ESLint, Prettier, and a static PWA architecture.
- Implemented the playable splash → menu → campaign/modes → briefing → hunt → results flow.
- Added mouse, keyboard and touch-pointer play, reload, pause, fullscreen, scoring, combos, protected-bird penalties, synthesized audio, animated birds and responsive HUD.
- Added deterministic RNG/round plans, scoring, input/controller translation, versioned saves/migration/recovery, and seven unit tests.
- Added twelve habitat records, nine selectable modes, a field guide, settings, achievements/records screens and controller simulator.
- Added offline PWA generation, CI/Pages workflow, asset scripts, screenshots, and the full required documentation set.

## Current architecture

- Phaser provides the responsive playfield; accessible DOM overlays provide menus/settings. Pure strict TypeScript modules under `src/core` own deterministic domain logic.
- Original visual direction: crisp 16-bit-inspired Alaska landscapes, navy/glacial-blue/spruce/lichen/safety-amber palette, clipped-corner HUD panels, layered parallax and restrained weather effects.

## Commands that work

- `node --version` (v22.22.2)
- `npm --version` (10.9.7)
- `git --version` (2.55.0)
- `gh auth status` (authenticated as `epi13`)
- `npm run generate:assets`
- `npm run validate:assets`
- `npm run check`
- `npm run test:e2e`

## Tests that pass

- Vitest: 7 tests passing in 1 file.
- Playwright: Chromium startup/navigation/settings and gameplay/manifest/responsive flows configured; targeted browser automation and production screenshots completed.

## Known issues

- Phaser remains a large browser bundle (about 343 kB gzip); Vite reports a non-failing chunk-size warning.
- The field-guide gameplay database is a curated launch subset; regulatory documentation lists the broader annual verification policy.

## Next steps

- Final Git review, commit, push, and GitHub Pages status check.

## Latest commit hash

- Pending release commit (parent: `70a3d70`).
